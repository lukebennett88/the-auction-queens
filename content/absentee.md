If you cannot attend the sale, you can place an _Absentee Bid_ before the sale begins. This is a free and confidential service.

## How to place your absentee bid

Please fill in the following online form so that we receive it _before_ the start of the auction. If you have trouble with the form please email us direct at [theauctionqueens@gmail.com](mailto:theauctionqueens@gmail.com).

The form tells us the maximum amount you are prepared to bid. Remember that a "Buyer's Premium" also applies on all lots sold â€” the rate is 15% (GST inclusive.)

## How we use your bid

Lots will be bought as reasonably as is allowed by other bids and any reserves, and in accordance with the [Terms and Conditions](/terms/) of Auction Sale.

While we always endeavour to ensure that all absentee bids are lodged with the Auctioneer and executed, _we accept no liability_.

## After the sale

If your bid is successful and you have provided us with an email address, you will automatically receive a notification email and invoice from us. If not, you must contact us to find out if your bids were successful.

Items must be paid for prior to postage or at pick-up, any post & handling fees will be added to the total. Payment for goods is by Cash, Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard, Direct Debit (EFTPOS), or Cheque (by prior arrangement).
